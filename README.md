# Henry Apata

**Product Designer & Builder** — I design it, then I build it.

Lead product designer who goes beyond the handoff. I think in systems, prototype in code, and ship products end-to-end — from user research to production React components.

Currently building with AI-augmented workflows using Claude, Cursor, and Next.js to move faster without compromising craft.
